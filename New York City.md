## Ridgewood

The best neighborhood, but don't tell anyone.

## Getting out of the city

A few spots I recommend:

#### The Adirondacks

Where you can see the stars.

I've gone up to the mountains a couple of times, staying in Minerva and Lake Placid. Minerva is really cute but a bit far from many of the trailheads. Lake Placid has easier access but is more urban. The High Peaks Wilderness is great, and I recommend climbing Mt Marcy. In the winter, you can cross-country ski and show-shoe, and walk out on Mirror Lake. The rest of the year, there's no shortage of lake activities to enjoy as well, such as swimming or kayaking.

#### The Hudson Valley
- DIA Beacon (I'm a sucker for Michael Heizer's stuff)
- Bruised Apple Books has top-tier used book smells
- hiking, then walking along the little main streets, getting ice cream etc.
- Mt Beacon is overrated - do another hike instead, like Bull Hill or Bear Mountain
