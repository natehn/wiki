### North Island

**The Sky**
```
Here, the sky is close.
The cold stars blow through my hair,
Just out of my reach.
```

{{< vimeo 131854167 >}}

**Rugged**
```
A rugged landscape:
Foreboding mountains and seas
Never cede domain.
```

**Distant**
```
Distant mountain peaks
Over supple, lively green
And my lack of words
```

**It Sets**
```
The sun sets orange light
Upon the rugged path, bright
Soon to rise again.
```

**Hills**
```
Aching feet keep step
With the insistent rhythm
Of a boy's schedule.

It's uphill one way
Downhill and uphill again
Endless hills of green

Pain, now forgotten:
This unfathomable beauty
Heals body and soul.
```

#### Auckland
- excellent contemporary theatre
- take the ferry to the valcano hike
- explore the public-private park (sheep!)

#### Wellington

**Wellington, a haiku**
```
Candles on mountains;
The flickering light of lives
Glowing by the sea
```

**Blinded**
```
This country blinds me;
Whether waking or dreaming,
It is all I see.
```

*Memories*:
- The All Seeing Hand live at a bowling club

**Kiwis**
```
We are all the same,
The sarcastic kiwi said.
And I simply laughed.
```

### South Island

**Bus**
```
Through grubby windows
One witnesses a new world,
The unknown made known.
```

{{< vimeo 133644378 >}}

**To Wanaka**
```
The road winds slowly
Towards a lake of clear glass,
My own reflection.
```

{{< figure src="/lake wanaka.jpg" caption="Lake Wanaka." >}}

**Pub Quiz**
```
Distant, white mountains
Stand high with caps out of sight
Seeming infinite
```

{{< vimeo 134398045 >}}

**Alps**
```
Great high sentinels
Selfishly guarded by clouds
Quietly peek through
```

{{< figure src="/kepler track.jpg" caption="The snowy Kepler Track." >}}

**Winter Sun**
```
The winter sun burns
My eyes submit, averted
It is far too strong
```

**Low-Hanging Clouds**
```
The light mist tarried
Above the dark green mountains
A natural twilight
Of beauteous, verdant forces
And I wondered
If I could fly
```

### Leaving

**Off and On**
```
On a plane, you're off.
We had something going on,
But now it's long gone.
```

**Jetstar**
```
A jet to the stars--
Just kidding; this airline sucks.
But at least it's cheap.
```
