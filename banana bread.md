## Ingredients
- **2/3 c. butter** (and some butter for the pan)
- **1 c. sugar** (can be replaced by 3/4 c. maple syrup)
- **2 eggs, large**
- **2 1/2 c. flour**
- NEW: **2 tsp ground cinnamon**
- **1 tsp. baking soda**
- **1/2 tsp. salt**
- **1 1/3 c bananas** (best if drippingly overripe - approx 6 bananas)
- NEW: **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **1/2 c. buttermilk** (can be replaced by 1/4 cup full-fat unsweetend oat milk and 1 tsp lemon juice mixed together and left to sit for a few minutes)
- **1 c. semisweet chocolate chips**, 1 c. chopped walnuts, or 1/2 c. fresh blueberries (reduce liquids a bit if using blueberries)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 300Â°F.
2. Set out the butter until room temperature *(not melted but if you stick your finger in it, it gives way)*.
3. Mash the bananas.
4. Cream butter.
5. Add sugar and continue creaming until fluffy. 

***Creaming** simply means mixing your butter and sugar(s) together until well blended, leaving you with a fluffy light yellow mix. Just do not over-mix! Butter and sugars are over-mixed when the butter begins to separate.*

6. Beat in eggs one at a time.
7. Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with bananas and buttermilk, mixing after each addition.

***Sifting dry ingredients:** I do sift my flour as I am measuring it but then I use a wire whisk to mix in the baking soda and salt.
**Adding alternately:** I add half of the dry, then add the bananas, add the rest of the dry and then the buttermilk or something like that.*

8. Stir in nuts or chips.

#### Option 1. Bread
9. Butter the pan.
10. Pour into 2 greased 1-pound loaf pans. (I use 1 larger pan.)
11. Bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes at 300F or 1 hour at 325F in the middle of the oven. (*Note*: I'm going to test my oven temperature to double-check this.)
12. Cool on rack.

#### Option 2. Muffins
9. Pour into muffin cups (2 muffin tins with 12 muffin cups each).
10. Bake for 15-18 minutes in the middle of the oven. [this at 325F]
11. Cool on rack.

*"It's better to err on the side of a lower temperature than a higher temp. Part of the reason I prefer to make muffins is because this recipe is very moist and it can be hard to get a loaf baked all the way through. Love, Mom"*
