*sources: my Aunt Janet ("Tasty Delights" cookbook pg. 53) was the source of the original recipe. The hard-boiling technique is from [Elizabeth Karmel](https://apnews.com/article/f7c85e49bc1c4519b4ec221d0288b6c3) via my ex's mom.*

## Ingredients
*Amount per Scottish Egg:*
- **2.5 classic-flavor [Beyond Breakfast Sausages](https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/beyond-breakfast-sausage-classic/)** (six patties per package)
- **1 eggs** (for hard-boiling)
- Approx. **1/4 egg** (left raw, for sausage mixture)
- Approx. **1/4 slice bread**, can be stale (but not moldy), or **1.5 tbsp finely ground bread crumbs**

## Directions



**Prep, pt. 1:**

1. Take the Beyond Breakfast Sausage out of the freezer to thaw.
2. Fill a heavy-duty 4-quart pot with cold water.
3. Gently place eggs (for hard-boiling) in the pot.
4. Bring the water to a boil and cover the pot.
5. Turn the heat off and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
6. Remove the pot from the stove with the eggs inside, and place it in the sink.
7. Remove the eggs one by one to peel them, leaving the rest in the water they were boiled in.
8. Crack the bottom of each egg and slip the eggshell off.
9. Rinse them in the hot water to remove any small shell fragments.
10. Place the eggs in the fridge to cool.
11. If not using premade bread crumbs, toast the bread, break it into pieces, and chop into even smaller pieces.

**Prep, pt. 2:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
2. Break the remaining egg(s) for the sausage mixture into a bowl and whisk with fork.
3. Break sausages into small pieces and mix them thoroughly with the raw egg.
4. Divide the mixture into the number of Eggs you plan to make.
5. Wrap each cold hard-boiled egg in the sausage mixture, covering it completely.
6. Roll the sausage-covered egg in bread crumbs to help keep it together.

**Baking:**

1. Place in a covered baking dish (e.g., casserole dish, bread dish covered in aluminum foil).
2. Bake for 30 minutes. 
3. Uncover and cook for 5-10 more minutes to brown.

Future experiment: try with aioli sauce.

*Notes: The prep work can be done the night before if baking in the morning. Remember to put leftover Beyond patties back in the freezer. Although these are properly known as "Scotch" Eggs, our family calls them "Scottish" Eggs.*
