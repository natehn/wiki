_Mix-in combinations that have worked:_

-   4 leeks, 1 shallot, 1 small onion, 1 heirloom tomato, ~3 oz. goat cheese crumbles
-   1/2 bunch of broccoli leaf ([chopped and steamed](https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/healthy-recipes/broccoli-leaves-recipe-ideas?slide=7d41c2bc-857b-4b56-b870-0cb149d7a4f8#7d41c2bc-857b-4b56-b870-0cb149d7a4f8)), 1/2 large onion, 1 king oyster mushroom, 1 tiny shallot, 3 tbsp goat cheese, 3 tbsp grated cheddar cheese

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2.  Prepare mix-ins.
3.  Chop and sautee vegetables in butter until soft and starting to lightly brown.
4.  Beat eggs in mixing bowl.
5.  Add thyme, pepper, salt to mix.
6.  Add non-vegetable mix-ins to egg mix. Stir.
7.  When vegetables are sauteed, let cool for a few minutes and then add to mix and pour into a bread pan.
