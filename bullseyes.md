a.k.a eggs-in-baskets, egg-in-a-holes, etc.

## Ingredients

-   **butter** (approx. 1 tbsp. per serving)
-   **bread slice** (one per serving)
-   **large egg** (one per serving)

## Directions

**Prep:**

1.  Set out the butter so that it reaches room temperature.
2.  Lightly toast the bread in a toaster or on the skillet (`6` or so on Nathan's NYC electric stove).
3.  Butter the bread slices generously.
4.  Using a knife, cut a hole in each bread slice, setting the scraps aside for now.

_The holes should be approx. 2.5x2.5"_ or _2x3". They can vary depending on the size of eggs you are using. You can also use a small glass to cut the holes depending on the size of the bread, but I prefer to use a knife._

5.  Heat a skillet over medium heat. _(`4.5/10` on Nathan's old electric stove)_

**For each piece:**

6.  Break an egg into a bowl and throw away the shell.
7.  Put a little bit of butter in the skillet.
8.  Place a bread slice in the skillet and pour the egg into the middle hole. 
9.  Lightly scramble the egg with your spatula while it cooks inside the hole.
10.  Once the egg has has set on the bottom, swiftly flip using spatula and scramble again. Keep flipping and scrambling until cooked most of the way through (a little bit of liquid is okay).
11.  Serve bullseye immediately, or place in warm oven if serving everyone simultaneously.

**Bread-holes:**
- Before or after the bullseyes, take the scraps - the bread-holes - and fry them up a bit more in some butter.
