## Ingredients

Big Bowl 1:

-   **1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour**
-   **1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon**
-   **1 teaspoon baking powder**
-   **1 teaspoon cream of tartar**
-   **1/2 teaspoon baking soda**
-   **1/2 teaspoon ground ginger**
-   **1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom**
-   **1/4 teaspoon salt**
-   **1/4 teaspoon allspice**
-   **1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper**

Smaller (but not tiny) Bowl 2:

-   **1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened**
-   **3/4 cup granulated sugar**
-   **1 large egg**
-   **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 F.
2.  Combine the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, cream of tartar, baking soda, ginger, cardamom, salt, allspice, and black pepper; stir with a whisk.
3.  In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a hand-held mixer on low speed just until combined. Mix in the egg and vanilla until incorporated.
4.  Add all of the butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until incorporated.
5.  Roll into 1.5-2 tbsp balls - slightly taller instead of perfectly round - and place on two cookie sheets.
6.  Bake for 8-9 minutes or until lightly golden around the edges. The cookies will appear underdone and very soft. Cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
