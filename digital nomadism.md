## Planning

### Timing

Timing is key. For me, the right amount of time on the road was about 2 months (that's how lon I did it in 2015; in 2021 I traveled for four months). Although in 2021 I got my "second wind" at about the 3 month mark.

### Destination

Make sure that wherever you go excites you! And don't be afraid to change your mind about your plans.

### Accommodation

Being centrally located is key when you go to a new city. While downtown might not be the coolest neighborhood, it is often the most networked, with access to all (or at least, most) of the others.

If you do not have a car (like me) you will want to make sure that your accommodation is within the zone of car/bike/scooter-share programs, for easier movement.

Staying close to the city center typically provides more flexibility (in terms of access to other neighborhoods) and access to public transportation and ride-sharing/car-hailing services.
