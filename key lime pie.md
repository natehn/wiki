## Ingredients
- 14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup Key Lime Juice *(Grandmother: "You can buy Key Lime Juice in a jar like you can buy Lemon Juice in a jar. They are usually found side by side on the shelf. I like the brand Nellie and Joe's Key West, but any will do. Keep in refrigerator for future pies."")*
- 1 pt HEAVY whipping cream, divided into two
- 10" Keebler Graham Cracker Pie Crust *(Grandmother: "If you can't find this size, get 2 regular size crust for making 2 pies. I also like the Keebler Shortbread Crust."")*

*"So, now you have the Milk, Lime Juice, Whipping Cream and already-made Pie Crust."*

## Directions
1. In a large bowl put the milk (1 can) and the lime juice (1/2 cup) together and stir fast till it thickens a little.
2. Put that in the refrigerator.
3. Then whip 1/2 pt (half of allotted) heavy cream till a spoon stands upright.
4. Get the lime-milk mixture out of the refrigerator and FOLD the whipped cream slowly into the mixture.  
5. Take the inverted lid out of the crust; pour the mixture into the pie; and spread.
6. Take the inverted lid and flip it over to cover the pie and crimp the foil pan over in places to hold it on.
7. Refrigerate for 4 hours.
8. Take the 2nd carton of cream and whip the same *(see step 3)* and spread over the pie and replace the lid.
9. Refrigerate 1 hour. 

## Notes
*"It can be made the day before or day of use. Keep in refrigerator for a few days. After a couple of days the juice may seep out - the pie is still good. It may sound complicated but actually it is a quick pie and no cooking. It is fluffy and refreshing.  Hope you like it. Love, Grandmother."*
