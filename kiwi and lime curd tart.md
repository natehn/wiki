## Ingredients

**Tart Dough:**

-   1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
-   1/4 cup granulated sugar
-   1/2 tsp kosher salt
-   1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut in small pieces
-   1 large egg, yolk and white separated
-   1 tsp pure vanilla extract
-   2 tbsp ice-cold water

**For filling:**

-   1 cup granulated sugar
-   3/4 cup + 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
-   finely grated zest of 3 limes
-   1/2 cup fresh lime juice, from about 5 limes
-   4 large eggs
-   5 kiwis, peeled and sliced

## Directions

Make the dough:

1. Measure the flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. 
2. Sprinkle butter over top and pulse until the butter pieces are no bigger than lentils. 
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolk (be sure to reserve the white for the next step!), vanilla, and water. 
4. Sprinkle over the flour mixture and pulse a few times until mixture starts to form large clumps.  
5. Dump onto a parchment-paper-lined counter and gently press the dough together until it is cohesive. 
6. Form into a disk shape, wrap up in the parchment paper and refrigerate at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 days).

Make the curd:

1. To make the curd, bring the sugar, butter, lime zest and juice to a simmer over medium heat. 
2. In a bowl, lightly whisk the eggs. 
3. Very slowly (a tiny bit at a time) stream about half the hot lime mixture into the eggs while whisking constantly, then slowly whisk this egg mixture back into the remaining lime mixture in the saucepan.  
4. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  
5. Press through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then chill completely (either by stirring it over an ice bath, or by refrigerating at least 2 hours).

Bake the dough:

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF. 
2. Roll the dough between two layers of parchment paper into a 12" circle and transfer to a 9 1/2" tart pan, gently pressing into bottom and up sides.  
3. Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights (or dry beans). 
4. Blind bake the tart shell on the bottom oven rack for about 15 minutes, until it starts to look dry, then carefully remove pie weights and parchment.  
5. Continue baking until the crust is golden, 10 minutes longer. 
6. Lightly brush the inside with lightly-whisked reserved egg white (you won't need all of it) and continue baking for about 5 minutes more, until white is set shiny.  
7. Gently transfer to a wire rack and cool completely in the tart pan.

Construct the tart:

1. When crust and lime curd are both cool, pour the curd into the crust and top with kiwi slices.
