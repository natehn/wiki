### Austin
*Visit*: 2021

*Quick notes*: Like Lexington, but if they turned everything way up to 11 and didn't make any changes to the underlying infrastructure. I stayed in South Austin, which was nice, but due to my lack of a car, it might have been better to stay closer to the city center and north of the river.

*Cool spots*:
- Looking down Congress Ave to see the pink limestone state capitol building, even though they pass tons of awful laws there
- Electric Church (rad psych rock indoor/outdoor venue I heard about from my Lyft driver) + De Nada Cantina (a nearby spot with excellent chips 'n queso)
- BBQ outside of town

### Bisbee

A cute little artist town, down by the border.  It has a nice little main street, where I purchased some Buddha-shaped candles. I was there to participate in a binational art project called the Naco-Bisbee Mural Project.

### Chicago
*Visits*: twice in 2021, thrice in 2016, and once in 2014

In 2021, time I went to Pitchfork and saw two bands I was looking forward to. Animal Collective kind-of stunk, but Yaeji ttotally blew me away. I also got to see the Cubs, which was a lot of fun.

Pronounced "mackinaw." 

*Quick notes*: I went with my friend on a cold, rainy day in the off-season. We were pretty much soaked through, but we had the island pretty much to ourselves. 

After trying to avoid the horse sh*t and brownish, melting ice-slush, we went up to see Arch Rock, Fort Holmes, and Skull Cave. Then we tried to dry off a bit at the Mustang Lounge before taking the noon-thirty ferry back to the mainland, where we then drove home through a blizzard. Good times.
