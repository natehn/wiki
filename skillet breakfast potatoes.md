## Ingredients

-   **1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes**
-   **2 tablespoons butter**
-   **2 tablespoons olive oil**
-   **pinch of cayenne**
-   **pinch of salt and pepper**
-   **1/2 teaspoon garlic powder**
-   **1/2 teaspoon onion powder**
-   **1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika**
-   _optional:_ rosemary, thyme, (smashed) garlic clove

## Directions

### Prep

1.  Peel and quarter the potatoes. _(If using full-size potatoes, cut them in eighths.)_
2.  Boil 2-3 inches of water in a pot and then use a steamer basket (or a strainer) to suspend the potatoes above the water.
3.  Steam the potatoes for 6-10 minutes (or more) until almost cooked through. _(You should feel a little resistance when piercing the thickest part with a knife - but you don't want potatoes to cook all the way through.)_
4.  Let potatoes cool for at least 1 hour to room temperature.
5.  Dice the potatoes up into roughly 1/2 inch pieces.

### Cooking

6.  In a large skillet, heat the butter (2 tbsp) and olive oil (2 tbsp) over medium-high heat.
7.  If available, add the rosemary, thyme, and smashed garlic clove.
8.  Allow the butter to melt and the olive oil to heat through. (When the herbs start popping and sizzling, remove them and the garlic clove, and discard.)
9.  Add the potatoes in a single layer.
10.  Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, cayenne (pinch), garlic powder (1/2 tsp), onion powder (1/2 tsp), and smoked paprika (1/4 tsp), and toss to coat evenly.
11.  Cook the potatoes for a total of 8-10 minutes, flipping and tossing them every 2-3 minutes to ensure even browning.
12.  Taste for seasonings and adjust to preference. Serve immediately.

Also fun: adding mild curry powder.

## Notes

_You can prep these the night before, so they take less time to serve up in the morning._

_If you cannot steam them, you can also microwave the potatoes 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 minutes covered with a microwave lid._
