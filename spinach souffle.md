## Ingredients
- **1 small carton cottage cheese**
- **1 pkg 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach** *(Most grocery stores still sell frozen chopped spinach in 10 oz. boxes.)* 
- **3 eggs**
- **2 Tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter**
- **1/4 lb. shredded Cheddar**
- **3 Tbsp. flour**

## Directions
*"Short directions: Mix together, place in greased casserole dish, bake at 350F for 1 hour."*

1. Preheat oven at 350° F.
2. Thaw spinach in microwave *(takes about 4 minutes in ours)*.
3. Squeeze (don't just drain) water out of thawed spinach with a towel.
4. Grease casserole dish.
5. Melt butter in (glass) casserole dish
6. Mix in flour and then eggs *(don't add eggs first because they might partially cook in the hot butter)*.
7. Add cottage cheese, spinach, and cheddar cheese. Mix.
8. Bake at 350° F. *(I've never had it take an hour--usually around 45 minutes, I think, but then again, our oven is probably hotter than it's supposed to be.)*
