## Ingredients
- 6 oz elbow macaroni
- 6 oz evaporated milk
- 6 oz grated (tasty, melty) cheese
- (some salt, I guess)

(6-6-6 - the devil's ingredients)

## Directions
1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.
2. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.
3. Feel free to add in fun sauces, spices, etc.
