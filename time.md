## Alt calendars

We've got 12 months and 365 days in a year, 7 days in a week, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes make an hour, and 60 seconds to a minute. It's the standard because, well, the whole point is to keep everyone [on the same page](https://xkcd.com/2594/) (wouldn't want people just picking [what time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eISzv8Ry45U) [it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xQjGqrZpoc)). But there are [other possibilities](https://rosszurowski.com/log/2018/small-seasons-long-calendars/). Here are a few examples of modern/intellectual alternatives:

- [Julian day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day)
- [French Republican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar)
- [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar)
- [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) ([12 pomodoro workday](https://cblgh.org/12%20pomodoro%20workday/))
- [Arvelie and Neralie](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/time.html)([live](https://clock.xxiivv.com/))
- [Tenpo](https://tilde.town/~dustin/wiki/tenpo/)
- [Dastime](https://kor.nz/projects/dastime)

Examples where the calendar and time do not change, but they are show differently inclde [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals), [decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time), and the [HEXclock](https://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/).[^localization]

[^localization]: Not to mention [the small differences](https://brilliantmaps.com/how-to-write-the-date-in-different-countries/) that can [drive international teams crazy](https://xkcd.com/2562/)...

## Natural time

Ever since I started sending out [my newsletter](/connect/#personal-newsletter) on the solstices and equinoxes, I've felt more connected to the seasons, and to the Earth. Life feels more cyclical - or perhaps, in combination with the domainant [linear](https://tinyletter.com/AppliedDivinityStudies/letters/is-time-working-for-or-against-you) time our society now experiences, more like a [spiral](https://ideaspace.substack.com/p/theories-of-time?s=r). 

Another way to deepen the cyclical is finding time (no pun intended) to see sunrise and the sunset each day.

Many (all?) cultures used to experience the passage of time in concert with the changing of the seasons. But there [weren't always only four](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05399b.htm) - even in the West - and some Eastern cultures recognized as many as 24, sometimes called ["small seasons."](https://smallseasons.guide/) Farmer's almanacs, like [this contemporary one](https://www.emergentgoods.com/product/earthbound-farmers-almanac), also bring us back to our agricultural roots.
