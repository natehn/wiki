### Austin

*Visit*: 9 days, November 2021

*Quick notes*: Like [[Lexington]], but if they turned everything way up to 11 and didn't make any changes to the underlying infrastructure. I stayed in South Austin, which was nice, but due to my lack of a car, it might have been better to stay closer to the city center and north of the river.

*Cool spots*:
- Looking down Congress Ave to see the pink limestone state capitol building, even though they pass tons of awful laws there
- Electric Church (rad psych rock indoor/outdoor venue) + De Nada Cantina (a nearby spot with excellent chips 'n queso)

### Bisbee

Visit: 2016

### Chicago

I've been to Chicago a few times, including twice in 2021, thrice in 2016, and once in 2014.

This time I went to Pitchfork and saw two bands I was looking forward to. Animal Collective kind-of stunk, but Yaeji ttotally blew me away.

### Mackinac Island

Pronounced "mackinaw." 

*Quick notes*: I went with my friend on a cold, rainy day in the off-season. We were pretty much soaked through, but we had the island pretty much to ourselves. 

After trying to avoid the horse sh*t and brownish, melting ice-slush, we went up to see Arch Rock, Fort Holmes, and Skull Cave. Then we tried to dry off a bit at the Mustang Lounge before taking the noon-thirty ferry back to the mainland, where we then drove home through a blizzard. Good times.
