Where I've been, at least that I'm willing to share, in alphabetical order.

## Overview
I grew up in the United States Midwest and have visited 30/51 US states and 10/63 National Parks.[^dc] I'm currently based in [[New York City]].

[^dc]: I'm including DC but not PR. Airports do not count.

**Other countries I've visited:** Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Czechia, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Germany, Italy, México, The Netherlands, New Zealand

I used to make ["video postcards"](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3439157) and zines (printable versions: [nz](/new-zineland.pdf), [eu](/where-am-i.pdf), [china](<[china](/zine-dynasty.pdf)>)) of my travels. I still share some [photos](https://photos.natehn.com), every now and again.
