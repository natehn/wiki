## New Zealand

*Visit*: 2015

In addition to the videos below, I also made a zine ([printable version only](/new-zineland.pdf)).

### Bonus: layover in Sydney

I know, Australia and New Zealand are different. I would liken it to the relationship between Canadians and Americans. One is smaller, cooler, and chiller, and less economically powerful, than the other. Funnily enough, when I was in NZ, I walked up to a Canadian and asked her where in the US she was from XD and then we spent the rest of the day together

From my layover in Sydney:

### Austin

*Visit*: 9 days, November 2021

*Quick notes*: Like [[Lexington]], but if they turned everything way up to 11 and didn't make any changes to the underlying infrastructure. I stayed in South Austin, which was nice, but due to my lack of a car, it might have been better to stay closer to the city center and north of the river.

*Cool spots*:
- Looking down Congress Ave to see the pink limestone state capitol building, even though they pass tons of awful laws there
- Electric Church (rad psych rock indoor/outdoor venue I heard about from my Lyft driver) + De Nada Cantina (a nearby spot with excellent chips 'n queso)

### Bisbee

*Visit*: 2016

A cute little artist town, down by the border.  It has a nice little main street, where I purchased some Buddha-shaped candles. I was there to participate in a binational art project called the Naco-Bisbee Mural Project.

### Chicago

I've been to Chicago a few times, including twice in 2021, thrice in 2016, and once in 2014.

### Mackinac Island

Pronounced "mackinaw." 

*Quick notes*: I went with my friend on a cold, rainy day in the off-season. We were pretty much soaked through, but we had the island pretty much to ourselves. 

After trying to avoid the horse sh*t and brownish, melting ice-slush, we went up to see Arch Rock, Fort Holmes, and Skull Cave. Then we tried to dry off a bit at the Mustang Lounge before taking the noon-thirty ferry back to the mainland, where we then drove home through a blizzard. Good times.
