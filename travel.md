I love to travel. I'll be writing more about it at some point...as soon as I get home from my current long-term trip.

### worst Airbnbs

1. A basement in an "active household" with five small kids, two dogs, endless dog toys, children's television, and a paper-thin ceiling, in Grand Rapids, MI.
2. A basement with low ceilings - so low that I could not stand up straight - in Wheeler, WV.
3. The time I had to break into my own room following the host's instructions, in San Francisco, CA.

On this lonely road,
Though crowded with travelers,
I still feel alone.
