## Ingredients

-   **1/2 cup peanut butter** _(or allergy-friendly sub)_
-   **3/4 tsp baking soda**
-   **3 tbsp flour** _(spelt, white, oat, sorghum, and rice all work)_
-   **1/3 cup sugar** _(unrefined if desired)_
-   **2 tbsp applesauce**
-   **1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract**
-   **1/8 tsp salt**

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2.  Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
3.  If your peanut butter is not stir-able, gently warm to soften.
4.  Add all remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl and stir to form a dough.
5.  Roll into cookie balls.
6.  If you want soft cookies, refrigerate the dough at least an hour.
7.  Bake for 8 minutes.

_The cookies will look quite underdone when you take them out._

8.  Let cool for at least 10 minutes before removing from tray, as they firm up while cooling.

### Notes

_Yields 7-10 cookies. You can also freeze cookie dough balls to bake at another time if you wish._

_Since there are no raw eggs, you get to eat as much raw cookie dough as you could possibly want._
