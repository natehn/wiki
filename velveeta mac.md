## Ingredients

-   **2 cups pasta** _(shells or elbows or whatever)_
-   **2 tablespoons butter**
-   **2 Tbsp. flour**
-   **1 1/2 cups milk**
-   **3/4 lb. Velveeta** _(I use low-fat)_

## Directions

1.  Cook pasta according to package directions.
2.  In another pan melt butter.
3.  Add flour. Stir until smooth.
4.  Gradually add milk; bring to a boil.
5.  Coo and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
6.  Reduce heat.
7.  Stir in Velveeta until melted.

_(Note: if you don't stir the sauce pretty constantly it will start to stick to the bottom of the pan.)_

8.  Drain the pasta; add to the cheese mixture.
